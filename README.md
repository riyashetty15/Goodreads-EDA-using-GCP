# Goodreads-EDA-using-GCP

I made use of the Google Cloud Platform to create a recommendation system since a cloud platform is highly useful in constructing efficient and scalable apps.

I created this recommendation system in PySpark, a distributed computing framework that does fast dynamic, large-scale data processing by using parallel computing. I used Spark API calls to leverage Python with the PySpark framework. It can do both memory and disk computations for faster data processing. There are certain steps that need to be done to create storage on the Google cloud.
